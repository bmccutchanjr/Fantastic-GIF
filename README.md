# Fantastic-GIF

A demonstration of APIs.

The page dynamically creates buttons based on user inputs and then uses those buttons to interface with GIPHY.com and BandsInTown.com to display a number of .GIF images (with proper credit to the creator of the image) and upcoming tour dates.

localStorage is used to save button text (used to create the buttons when the page is loaded) and favorite images.

jQuery is used to manipulate the DOM and to interface with the APIs.
